## Background
I wanted all the [The Burkiss Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burkiss_Way) mp3s from [RadioEchoes.com](http://radioechoes.com).  In order to get the mp3 urls from the show page, one must click "download mp3", which opens a *second* page (typically in overlay), and that second page has the link.  So I wrote this simple scraper.

## Later on...
I decided to use this project as the basis for a talk with tags as steps & I don't keep the readme up to date on each step. As such the readme **may/will be inaccurate** 'til the end when I'll update it all to reflect the state of the project.

## Usage
:warning: Changes from step to step, watch the talk @todo link to talk :warning:
Will update in the end

## License

## Special Thanks
to duchess & the entire honeyhole team, without whom this wouldn't have been possible
